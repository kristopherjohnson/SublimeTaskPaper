## Sublime Text 2 Syntax Definition File for TaskPaper-format Files

This is a simple syntax definition file for reading TaskPaper files in Sublime Text 2.
(It might work in TextMate too, but I haven't tried it.)

To use it, simply copy the `TaskPaper.tmLanguage` file into your Sublime Text 2 `Packages/User` directory, and restart Sublime Text 2.

### Features

- Automatically opens files with `.taskpaper` suffix as TextPaper format
- Project names, notes, and tags are displayed with special highlighting. (Tasks are displayed as plain text.)
