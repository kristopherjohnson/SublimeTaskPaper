## Sublime Text 2 Syntax Definition File for TextPaper-format Files

This is a simple syntax definition file for reading TaskPaper files in Sublime Text 2.
(It probably works in TextMate too, but I haven't tried it.)

To use it, simply copy the TaskPaper.tmLanguage file into your Sublime Text 2 Packages/User directory, and restart Sublime Text 2.
