This is a simple syntax definition file for reading TaskPaper files in Sublime Text 2.
(It probably works in TextMate too, but I haven't tried it.)

To use it, simply copy the TaskPaper.tmLanguage file into your Sublime Text 2 Packages/User directory, and restart Sublime Text 2.

You are free to use, copy, redistribute, modify this file in any way you like.

This is neither supported nor endorsed by the makers of TaskPaper.
